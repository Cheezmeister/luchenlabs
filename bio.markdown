title: About Me
---

Hey there. Pleased to make your acquaintance. I'm a proud geek, born 
and raised on Long Island, New York, but itching to see the world. I 
have an $80,000 piece of paper from [RIT](http://www.rit.edu) that says 
"Bachelor of Science" in large ornate letters, and though I 
can't help growing older, I still haven't gotten around to growing up. 

### I Am ###
A [gamer](http://backloggery.com); 
a [hac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footbag)[ker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Programming); 
a [reader](http://filer.case.edu/dts8/thelastq.htm);
a [writer](tidbits/arrgh.txt);
an [addict](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Dew); 
a [lyricist](http://www.amiright.com/parody/80s/bryanadams25.shtml); 
a [hippie](http://www.ecogeek.org/);
a skier; a skater;
a teacher, and a learner. 

I sincerly enjoy learning in all its forms; whenever 
I find something cool or useful, I can't resist playing with it. This 
sometimes results in late homeworks. On the flip side, I get a kick out of 
sharing what knowledge I have effectively with others, especially with kids. 
There's something magical about the passing of insight from one mind to 
another, and I hope to one day save a few young minds from being stifled in the 
halls of mediocrity known as the US public school system.


##  Stuff I Think Is Awesome ## 

### Sonic Robo Blast 2 ###
[http://srb2.org](http://srb2.org)
SRB2 has the dual honors of being, in this author's experience, one of the most elaborate Doom WADs out there, as well as arguably the **only** Sonic game to successfully pull off 3D platforming, which is even more incredible for a fangame. It's also a whole lot of fun. Go ahead and try it out if you haven't yet.

### Temporal ###
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal (game)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_%28video_game%29)
This bizarre time-travel based puzzle adventure from Oren Bartal and 
Potato Factory doesn't get nearly as much lovin' as it deserves. In it, you 
control an adorable, somewhat snarky robot trying to figure out just what the 
heck is going on. The puzzles are some of the best I've ever seen, requiring 
lateral thinking of a caliber on par with Braid or Portal. Much
like those games, the story is expertly woven into the gameplay; no monstrous 
cutscenes.  Also, it mocks [Clippit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clippit). You 
just can't beat that.

###  The SDL ### 
[http://www.libsdl.org](http://www.libsdl.org/)
The Simple DirectMedia Layer, or SDL for short, is the open source 
community's answer to DirectDraw (and then some). It is a compatibility layer 
that can use X11, DirectX, and a host of other backends on dozens of different 
platforms, including the primary three. It's quite flexible, but extremely 
easy to use.  Many, like myself, start using it as an introduction to 2D 
graphics, but once you start digging, you'll find that SDL has a ton of neat 
features that go beyond just graphics, and is extremely robust. SDL 2.0 is a 
long-awaited update, and it supports Android & iOS too. Sweet!

### CMake ###
[http://www.cmake.org](http://www.cmake.org/)
CMake is pure awesome, topped with awesomesauce. To anyone who's gone through
the pain of maintaining a `Makefile`, writing a `configure` script, or even
had to use an unfamiliar IDE, this tool is good news. Despite its name, it's 
not a substitute for `make`, nor will it make your project for you. Instead, 
it's more like a meta-make: it generates, from a file called `CMakeLists.txt
`, the native build tool of your choice. The simplest use is a typical `cmake 
. && make` from a command line. This is comparable to a `./configure && make`, 
except you get nice colored output from your Makefile instead of shell spew. 
But what if you're on Windows? Well, you can just as easily process the CMake 
script with the Windows GUI and output a Visual Studio solution. On a Mac, you 
can get Xcode projects. Eclipse CDT? Yeah, it does that too. When one does lots 
of guerrilla coding, it's easy to overlook how much time one wastes by playing 
with different project files and settings to get things working on a 
given platform; with CMake, there is none of that, and life is good.

In short: Heavily cross-platform, the build tool of your choice, a nice
interface, an intuitive but powerful script language make for a wonderful tool.

### Haskell ###
[http://www.haskell.org](http://www.haskell.org)
Haskell seems to be gaining popularity lately, and I can see why: it combines
the functional paradigm, which hardcore computer scientists love; a terse
and powerful syntax that's not in the slightest overcome with parentheses; a
slick package manager, Hackage, that's somewhat like a Haskellified CPAN; and
highly optimized compilation to machine code. In short, it's fun, fast, 
elegant and philosophically viable. It's also the basis for Hakyll, which 
brought you this awesome website!

### OverClocked ReMix ###
[http://ocremix.org](http://ocremix.org)
Founded in 1999 by David "djpretzel" Lloyd, this not-for-profit venture has 
blossomed into *the* site for game music arrangements. Anyone can submit a 
recording to the site, but each piece is reviewed carefully by a panel of 
judges before being added; the site therefore has a reputation for quality.
It's a great source of new takes on some of your favorite video game tunes. 
From oldies like Vectorman to current-gen titles, if it has a good soundtrack
(and even if it doesn't), there's a good chance you can find a remix here. Did
I mention it's all DRM free and *gratis* as well?

### FIRST ###
[http://www.usfirst.org](http://www.usfirst.org)
Dean Kamen, inventor of the [Segway](http://www.segway.com), is prone to
bizzarre, brilliant, wonderful, awful ideas. So, naturally, he thought, "why
not create a varsity sport for geeks?" So, 20 years ago, he founded **F**or
**I**nspiration and **R**ecognition **I**n **S**cience and **T**echnology, an 
organization dedicated to advocating engineering among youngsters through
annual robotics competitions. The flagship event, FRC, involves high-schoolers
from around the globe designing and building robots to play a game which
varies from year to year. Other competitions have spawned to include younger 
students and those who can't bankroll a full-blown robot, but the spirit of 
teamwork, problem-solving and what Dean calls "gracious professionalism"
remains throughout. I wouldn't be the person I am today if it weren't for my
four years on an FRC team. There aren't many other places where one can spend
a summer learning to solder, program, and segway joust at the same time.

### Cheez ###
Cheez is made from the curds of milk, typically a cow's. It's delicious, nutritious, and plays a key role in [the first game I developed](projects/cheezus).
