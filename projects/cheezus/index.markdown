Cheezus is a typical platformer with a few twists in presentation and level 
design; it's some of the worst code I've ever written, but I learned an 
immense amount putting it together and I'm still rather partial to it. You 
play as a piece of Swiss cheez and do some rather bizarre things(you'll see 
what I mean). Music's my original composition, sprites (the better ones, 
anyway) done by Rich "Spyke" DeFrancisco, and many thanks to the 
[Lazy Foo](http://lazyfooproductions.com/SDL_tutorials/index.php) for 
teaching me everything I know about SDL. Enjoy!

This project is my baby, in several senses. I'm proud of it. I want it to
flourish. It's been bittersweet watching it age five years (has it really been
that long?); oh, and it was also sort of an accident.

Flash back to 2006. I'm a frustrated high schooler. My teachers rave about how
talented I am, yet they continue to pour on tons of coursework that is all but 
irrelevant. I can't find a summer job. My parents insist I should take the 
summer off, like a normal kid. I've recently discovered the wonderful world 
of computer programming, and I've been hanging out at a small *GameFAQs* 
message board trying to learn all I can. I've exhausted the novelty of Hello 
World, Guess the Number, and even Lazy Foo's classic "move the ball" examples
, so I decide to try something a bit more ambitious: a level editor. 

*A level editor, of all things?*, you must be thinking, *Surely, this must
be in preparation for some delightful game project!* Well, yes and no. It is
true that my fledgling editor became my main tool for designing the levels
in *Cheezus*, but I didn't mean to! Honest! It started out as an exercise.

I've always been a huge fan of video games, and like many others, I'd
considered making them as a grown-up, but I held no illusions about the
difficulties involved, and made it a point to keep every proverbial door open 
for myself. I tried not to feed my growing interest in game development as a 
hobby, let alone as a profession. This notwithstanding, I finished a useful, 
if utilitarian, editor much more quickly than I expected to, and decided to 
spend the remainder of the summer programming a complete game to use the .lvl 
files my editor spit out. 

I like cheez, so I made the player's character a piece of cheez - running,
jumping, adventuring, transforming cheez. The rest of the design came together
haphazardly but remarkably well for a pile of satirical nonsense. Day by day, 
I chiseled out the engine - an awful, unmaintainable, memory-leaking mess, but 
a complete custom engine - hunted down bugs, tested each level relentlessly,
and finally used some recent Music Theory knowledge to sequence background 
music. By the end of the summer, I had a game I was proud of, and that people 
even seemed to like!

[Installer](/downloads/InstallCheezus.exe): Windows 
only, I'm afraid, though I've been told it works under Wine.
