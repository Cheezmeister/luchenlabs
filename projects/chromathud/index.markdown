Chromathud is a somewhat educational math-based rising block puzzle currently in development in collaboration with one Mister [David Silverman](http://davesilvermanart.com/) with help from a certain Niels Van Hecke. The only math involved is addition, but it's the core mechanic. Blocks are numbered from 1 to 9 and they're cleared by selecting a few blocks which add up to a randomly chosen target number. 

The game is deceptively simple, but twists come in the form of time bonuses; penalties for deselecting blocks; and clearing by traditional groups of four or more touching blocks. 

You can find a brief review of Chromathud [here](http://indiegameschannel.com/wp/2010/12/21/igf-2011-review-chromathud-by-luchenlabs/), and may or may not be able to play it online via [Spoon](http://spoon.net/chromathud).
