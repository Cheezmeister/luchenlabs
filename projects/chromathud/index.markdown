Chromathud is a loosely math-based rising block puzzle currently in development in collaboration with one Mister David Silverman with help from a certain Niels Van Hecke. The only math involved is addition, but it's the core mechanic. Blocks are numbered from 1 to 9 and they're cleared by selecting a few blocks which add up to a randomly chosen target number. 

The game is deceptively simple, but twists come in the form of time 
bonuses; penalties for deselecting blocks; and clearing by traditional groups 
of four or more touching blocks.
