--- intro
Chromathud is a loosely math-based rising block puzzle currently in development in collaboration with one Mister David Silverman. I say loosely because the only math involved (the core mechanic) is addition. Blocks are numbered from 1 to 9 and they\'re cleared by selecting a few blocks which add up to a randomly chosen target number. 

The game is deceptively simple, but twists come in the form of time 
bonuses; penalties for deselecting blocks; and clearing by traditional groups 
of four or more touching blocks.

The beta is out! This will be the last release for a while as we ready the game for the Xbox Indie Arcade and polish the final PC release to a fine sheen.
