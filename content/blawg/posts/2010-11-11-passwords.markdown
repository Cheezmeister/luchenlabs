I'm only going to say this once: web devs of the world, **fix your damn password creation**. I'm sick and tired of wasting my time trying 5 different passwords until I find one your system likes. I'm sick and tired of stupid length requirements. If I'm dumb enough to use a two-character password, let me. If I care enough to use 20 characters, *let me!*

I'm sick and tired of guessing at your silly requirements and being informed of the ones I missed ex post facto. 

I'm sick and tired of forgetting the stupid thing because your criteria were so esoteric. 

I'm sick and tired of seeing all kinds of silent failure because your two-bit JavaScript wasn't expecting punctuation.

And I'm sick and tired of seeing this lazy nonsense pretending to be for the sake of security.
