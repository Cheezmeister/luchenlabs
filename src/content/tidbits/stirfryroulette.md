Vegetables are disgusting, but they sure are healthy. I've begun to eat more veggies by disguising them as deliciousness by way of stir-frying them with just enough tasty meat and oil to fool my palate into thinking it's good. Then I douse it in spices to further hide that nasty vitamin flavour. It's like a trojan horse of nutrition--with minimal effort!
