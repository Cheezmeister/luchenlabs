Once, long ago, I made [Cheezus](cheezus). It was fun. It was educational.
And it contained a promise for a sequel. That sequel was quickly designed
and coding began forthwith. Three years later, development had tapered off
because college and stuff. When I attempted to pick it up again, I said
screw it and rewrote the whole goshdarn thing. Nearly seven years after
that, guess what's still not finished? And guess who's older and wiser,
enough NOT to say screw it and rewrite the whole goshdarn thing?

Yup. Staying true to my word, I am pulling this game kicking and screaming
across the finish line.

In Progress. See continuing DevLog on [TigSource](http://is.gd/JMaRak) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23cheezus2)
