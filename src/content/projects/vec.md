Vec is a procedural, dual-axis, polar-coordinate arcade thing I've been working on since GDC 2015. It's more of a toy than a game.  Spin around, shoot things and make pretty designs.

History
----------

After spending much of 2014 dabbling in modern tech like HTML5 and Unity and meeting with more frustration than productivity, I came to the unfortunate conclusion that the cool kids' tools simply do not click with my brain; and in any case they aren't well-suited to the synaesthetic procedural style of game that I'm trying to evolve. A winter's worth of following [Handmade Hero](http://handmadehero.org) convinced me to go [back to where I started](/projects/cheezus), that is, SDL and the [KISS principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/KISS_principle). Right around GDC, I managed to break the triangle barrier and "find the fun" in the form of an unusual control scheme and a minimalist aesthetic.
