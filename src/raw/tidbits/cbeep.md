Plays a little ditty on the system speaker. Hardware speakers are becoming a thing of the past, but on systems that have them, they're typically unaffected by the OS volume. In other words, they cannot be muted. I loaded this (with timer set) on a few computers for my high school senior prank. It went swimmingly!
