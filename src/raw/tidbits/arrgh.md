<br/> Well Pirate be as Pirate do, that's how it ought to be
<br/> A mighty tale I'll have to tell, is how it seems to me
<br/> Round five and twenty years ago, when I were just a lad,
<br/> Them scurvy Munchkins took me from me mother and me dad
<br/> Not half me height, but keen and crafty, demons from the deep
<br/> They stole inside, they stole upstairs, they stole me in me sleep
<br/> When I awakened, aye, we were surrounded by the sea
<br/> And ne'er have I since returned, a pirate's life for me!
<br/> I worked the galley, dawn 'til dusk, a lowly, stinkin' slave,
<br/> I served the Munchkins, fed myself what scraps a boy could save
<br/> Below the deck I met a fine lass, Gracie were her name
<br/> Her indigestion gripped her; she were gorgeous all the same.
<br/> I told 'er "Gracie darlin', one day--mark my words!--one day,
<br/> We'll leave these scallawaggers and together sail away!
<br/> We'll find some place that's pure and clean, with children and balloons
<br/> A paradise where all the streets are paved in gold dubloons!
<br/> Aye, years we toiled, we swabbed the deck with sweat and blood and tears
<br/> The sea Munchkins grew sloppy as we sailed away our years
<br/> They stopped the whippin's, fed me meat, and even shared their grog
<br/> Though slave I be, I were to them no more a scurvy dog
<br/> Until--at last!--from down below, one starry night, I saw 
<br/> The key to my own shackles, left atop a pile o' straw
<br/> I reached for it, but if it were that easy, matey, aye,
<br/> My arms were leagues away, I had to sit right back and sigh
<br/> But then--a roaming Octopus I took to calling Joe
<br/> Caught on to where my eyes were set (they're very sharp, you know)
<br/> Ol' Joe had fearsome tentacles, he grabbed that key with ease
<br/> Undid my shackles straightaway, I thanked him with some cheese.
<br/> And so, to keep my promise to my darlin', bless her soul,
<br/> I tiptoed from the brig, a Munchkin's cutlass thar I stole
<br/> Arrr, 'ere he could cry out, I quickly slashed the bilge rat's neck
<br/> And, smartly as a dolphin, made me way across the deck
<br/> That night I slew a dozen-dozen Munchkins as they slept
<br/> Just like they done to me--a fitting fate! Then, aye, I wept.
<br/> For Gracie, when I found her, were a painful sight to see
<br/> That very night--afraid, alone--she died of dysent'ry.

<br/> And so I sail, where'er wind blows, a cap'n with a crew
<br/> I hoist the jolly roger! Aye! A pirate through and through
<br/> I've sailed to Indones-i-a, I've sailed to Kathmandu,
<br/> I've seen the North Pole, matey, and I've seen the South Pole too
<br/> I've wrestled giant lobsters and the Kraken--fearsome, he
<br/> I've slain the legendary Fligga-Flubbadiddle-Dee
<br/> I've rescued seven princesses (I kidnapped two meself)
<br/> I've partied in Atlantis with a Caribbean Elf!
<br/> And yo-ho-ho, my journey here be almost at an end
<br/> Exhausted by my travels and deserted by my friends
<br/> I sail the River Styx, alone, in search of brighter shores
<br/> To find my darlin' Gracie and to tell her "lass, I'm yours"
<br/> But who am I to tempt these waters? Mortal, aye, I be
<br/> But mayhaps not for long, methinks, the grave be houndin' me
<br/> Me corsair's now a dinghy, and me cutlass be a knife
<br/> Me hat has one more feather, and I'm clingin' fast to life
<br/> I've buckled swash, I've cheated death, I've sailed eleven seas
<br/> But never have I seen a bunch o' waves the likes o' these.
<br/> A dozen-dozen angry spectres chill me to the bone
<br/> The Munchkins! Back for vengeance! I can hear them hiss and moan
<br/> A horde of wayward spirits without body, without home
<br/> Avast thar! They be tearin' at me breeches from the gloam!
<br/> But wait--Ahoy!--a warm glow through the mist lies right ahead
<br/> And on I must--can I make land before I wind up dead?
<br/> A Munchkin grips my shoe, my pistol fires to no avail
<br/> As I begin to wonder what what should happen if I fail
<br/> Well Pirate be as Pirate do, that's how it ought to be
<br/> A mighty tale I'll have to tell...
