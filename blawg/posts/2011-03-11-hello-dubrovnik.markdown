It's been a week since I arrived in Dubrovnik, and we've been getting along just fine. For the first few days I made sure to use the buddy system with other students who knew their way around the city better than I; now that I have the lay of the land, things should be a bit easier for the rest of the quarter.

The electronics situation isn't so peachy. I didn't get a chance to grab a Europe-to-US power adapter (whatever they're really called). So, I've been mooching off the others for that as well. This is somewhat less than reliable, and my gadgets and computers have been taking turns interrupting my routine by dying, preventing me from getting much of anything done in the past week. Needless to say, I've all but vanished from cyberspace. 

Most frustrating is the sudden loss of the ability to phone home. It's no big surprise that there's no Sprint service this side of the Atlantic (hah!) but spotty WiFi and a repeatedly-failing Droid battery have so far precluded VoIP as well. Incidentally, I've been relying on my Droid as a PDA lately, meaning that when it's not available, I have to remember things with my own forgetful brain. It's a sad state of affairs. One of these days, I'll get myself a handful of adapters, a transformer, and a cheap phone like the others have grabbed. 

One reason I've been so sluggish in getting properly settled is that I've been so busy experiencing Dubrovnik. In the week I've been here, I've climbed a small mountain, made friends with a bartender, and discovered how *not* to hang trousers on a clothesline. More often than not, I've been out past midnight--and that's just fine, seeing as how I (along with the majority of the group) have class only on Tuesday and Thursday, starting at 10.  

I think this will be a fun quarter.
