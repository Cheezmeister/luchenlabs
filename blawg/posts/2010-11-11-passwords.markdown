I'm only going to say this once: web developers of the 
world, **fix your damn password creation**. I'm sick and tired
of wasting my time trying 5 different passwords until I find
one your system likes. I'm sick and tired of stupid length requirements. If I'm dumb enough to use a two-character password, let me. If I care enough to use 20 characters, *let me!*
I'm sick and tired of guessing at your silly
requirements and being informed of the ones I missed ex post 
factum. I'm sick and tired of forgetting the stupid thing
because your criteria were so esoteric. And I'm sick and tired
of seeing this lazy nonsense pretending to be for the sake
of security.
